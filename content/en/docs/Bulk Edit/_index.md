The Bulk Edit app allows a user to apply changes to multiple FOLIO records simultaneously. 


Bulk edit can apply changes to these record types:


* **Inventory - holdings**
* **Inventory - instances**
* **Inventory - items**
* **Users**


## Permissions


The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Bulk Edit app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. Permissions are assigned to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Bulk Edit app or any related information. 


Bulk edit permissions, combined with other functional app permissions, allow a user to access specific areas of the Bulk Edit app. Depending on how your library runs bulk edit jobs, users may also need permissions in other modules, such as Export Manager, Inventory, Users, and Settings. For more information about permissions, see [Users \> Permissions](../users/#permissions). 


The following are the permissions for the Bulk edit app:


- **Bulk edit: In App - Edit user records.** This permission allows the user to edit multiple user records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Can build query**: This permission allows the user to build and test a query, and preview matched records in the Bulk edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Can view logs** This permission allows the user to download and view logs in the Bulk Edit app.
- **Bulk edit: In app - Edit inventory records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple inventory records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: In app - View inventory records** This permission allows the user to view a list of inventory records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Local - Edit user records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple user records in Bulk Edit using the CSV approach.
- **Bulk edit: Local - View user records** This permission allows the user to view a list of identified user records in Bulk Edit using the CSV approach.


## Bulk edit methods


The Bulk edit app provides two methods for editing records: 


* **Bulk edit**: The **Bulk edit** approach is also referred to as **In-app**. This approach allows the user to set criteria for the bulk edit by uploading a list of record identifiers from a .csv file. Once the records are identified and matched, **Bulk edit** allows the user to designate an action for these records and commit the changes to the records in FOLIOâ€™s user interface. 


* **Bulk edit (Local)**: The **Bulk edit (Local)** approach is also referred to as **CSV**. This approach uses a .csv file to display records matching a selected **Record identifier**. Changes are made to the records and saved in the .csv file, and committed to FOLIO by uploading the edited .csv file. 


Note that Microsoft Excel processes .csv files in ways that may change data unexpectedly, especially date and time fields. Reviewing the .csv data in a text editor helps ensure that no unexpected changes are made to records when using **Bulk edit (Local)**.


## Inventory - holdings


### Identify records


The Bulk edit app accepts only .csv files for upload. Files should include only one column of record identifiers. If the file contains more than one column, the upload will not be successful and a *Something went wrong* message will display. 


To set the criteria and identify records for bulk edit, follow these steps:


1. In the **Set criteria** pane, ensure **Record types** is set to **Inventory - holdings**.
2. In the **Set criteria** pane, select the **Record identifier** from the drop-down list. The record identifier you select should correspond to the type of record identifier in the .csv file.
3. Either **Drag and drop** your .csv file into the **Select a file** box, or click **or choose file** to locate the file on your computer. The .csv file automatically uploads and searches for matching **Holdings** records.


### Preview matched records


Once the file upload is complete, the matching **Holdings** records are listed in the **Preview of record matched** pane. To customize the column headings in the preview, click the **Actions** button. To add, check the box next to the column heading; to remove, uncheck the box or leave it empty. 


### Errors


The **Error** accordion contains a list of errors found when searching for the matched records, if any, and displays the errors in two columns:


* **Record identifier.** The identifier for the record that produced the error
* **Reason for error.** The reason the search did not result in a matched record. 


### Start bulk edit

### Start bulk edit (Local)

The **Bulk edit (Local)** function allows the user to perform a bulk edit on records edited locally (external to FOLIO) by uploading a .csv file of the changed, or edited, records. 

Any field in matching user records can be changed by using the Bulk edit (Local) approach.

Note that Microsoft Excel processes .csv files in ways that may change data unexpectedly, especially date and time fields. Reviewing the .csv data in a text editor helps ensure that no unexpected changes are made to records with **Bulk edit (Local)**.

To use **Bulk edit (Local)** approach to apply changes to records, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set criteria** pane, select Users as the **Record type** and select the appropriate **Record identifier**: User UUIDs, User barcodes, External IDs, or Usernames.
2. Upload a .csv file with the selected Record identifier by either using the **Drag and drop** option or clicking the **Choose file** button.
3. Select **Actions \> Download matched records (CSV)** to download a .csv file of matched user records; or select **Actions \> Download errors (CSV)** to download a .csv file of records that did not match your selected record identifier. 
4. Edit the downloaded .csv file and make changes to the user records in the file itself. Save the edited .csv file to your computer.
5. Select **Actions \> Start bulk edit (Local)**. 
6. In the **Bulk edit** window, **Drag and drop** the .csv file into the **Upload CSV file with edited records** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer. If the .csv file is uploaded successfully, the confirmation message, *(Name of File).csv successfully uploaded*, displays in a new window.
7. Click **Next**. The warning message, *(Number of) records will be updated if the **Commit changes** button is clicked.* appears in a new window.
8. Click **Commit changes**. Bulk edit will apply the local changes to the records in FOLIO.
